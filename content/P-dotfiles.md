# dotfiles

last updated: 2025-07-14

yes apparently im now that kind of nerd who puts her linux laptop config on the internet. there are major redactions in this repo (i'm being very on the safe side) and it is not updated live (i use a private repo for my dotfiles management with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/)). for more information read the README.

you can find [the repo here on my github](https://github.com/blltrx/dotfiles-public)
