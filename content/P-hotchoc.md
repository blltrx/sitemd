# hot chocolate tierlist

i've been ranking hot chocolate from various coffee shops for a little bit now, here are my reviews and current ranking. last updated 2025-03-01.

## Caffè Nero
hot chocolate classic: a bit bland and a bit sweet honestly fine. i've using this to be the reference point. (C)

luxury hot chocolate: richer, in some ill-defined way, better texture, different taste (better but not for me). (C)

## Spring Espresso (York)
a perfect basic hot chocolate. very solid no flaws. (B)

## Stage (Leeds)
hot chocolate: perfect texture, a bit melty, a bit too cocoa-y for me. (A-)

malted hot chocolate: perfect texture, a bit melty, a bit too cocoa-y for me, but now a bit malty yay! (A)

peppermint hot chocolate: surprisingly really good, i dont like anything remotely minty, but this is sutble and interesting. worst than usual because mint, but soo much better than expected. would happily drink a little bit because i find it interesting, but idk if i would want a whole cup. (B)

## Spoons
watery, not very milky, awful texture, sweet, little cocoa /neg. (F+)

## C
a friend of mine

hot chocolate (cadbury): not quite heavy enough, great taste. (A+)

hot chocolate (galaxy): not heavy enough, better, more chocolatly taste. what i remember costa tasting like before 2021. (S-)

## Costa 

hot chocolate: watery in taste and somewhat texture, sweet, little cocoa, much better than spoons tho. i swear it used to be soo much better. (C-) 

winter black forest hot chocolate: the same as the normal hot chocolate, but with a berry syrup kinda thing. it's nicer, and sweeter in a fun way, but the sweetness is very discontinuous with the rest of the drink and feels like its just been added on top (because it has). (C)

## Cooplands
watery in taste and somewhat texture, sweet, little cocoa, much better than spoons, worse than costa tho. (D) 

## Winter Tent LUU '24
salted caramel hot chocolate: watery in texture, but incredibly rich taste also alcahol yay! (A)

## GFAL
watery in taste and texture. (D-)

## H
a friend of mine.

good texture, weighy, but also not quite right (because non-dairy), sweet taste with some depth. (B+)

## Chocomel (microwaved milk)
actually awful idk why but it tastes like alternative milk without any fun or goodness, unlike using actual alt. milks. disappointed because i love the milkshake. (F+)

## Mog's (Leeds)
kind of watery compared to stage but otherwise good texture. sweet, chocolatey, and also something else that's good but idk what. (A-)

## Flamingos (Leeds)
not nearly thick enough to compliment the chocolatey taste, but good taste. tastes properly like chocolate. demoted from b to b- on '25-03-01 (B-)

## 200°
very similar to mogs, but substantially less flavourful, that being said much better texture and thats more important. (B+)

## Wapentake (Leeds) ('25-2)
sweet, chocolatly, not thin, almost perfect. as with all hot chocolates could be thicker (A+)

## Kulture Coffee (Leeds) ('25-3)
pretty plain and solid, in taste and texture (B+)
