# styleguide V=(° °)=V

## case

i don't really like the look of uppercase letters so almost everything is lowercase. the exceptions are names, or a style choice for that section.

**my name (whichever one) is generally lowercase.**

## colours

<div class="square blackbackground white">

<div class="square darkbackground white">

<div class="square secpurpbackground  black">

## font

idk the difference between a typeface and font but i don't care that much. i use Cascadia Code for all my things, and if your device has it that's what you'll see here.
