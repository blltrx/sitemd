## whoami
blltrx.
ex-catgirl puppygirl, a big fan of trains, and a capital letter hater. beyond the information on the home page, i usually go by rose or bellatrix (blltrx) online, which is generally all lowercase.

i use they/she pronouns and have some amount of gender, probably a lesbian, and more importantly i'm bad at maths.
