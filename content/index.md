# hello :)
hi! my name is bellatrix, but also sometimes rose (and sometimes I spell it roze).

i live in Leeds (UK).

my interests are mainly computer science, physics, music, and trains.

currently, i'm doing some things with trains ([visiting all the platform zeros in the Europe](/projects/plat0) and [speedrunning West Yorkshire National Rail stations](/projects/wymetro)), studying for a physics degree, and coding some random stuff. i also [rate hot chocolates](/projects/hot-choc).

most things i do make it to this website somewhere. i also take a lot of photos of trains that are on [my instagram](https://www.instagram.com/blltrxrose/).
