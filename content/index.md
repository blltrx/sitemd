# hello :)
hi! my name is bellatrix, but also sometimes rose (and sometimes I spell it roze).

i live in Leeds (UK). my interests are mainly in computer science, physics, music, and trains.

currently, i'm [visiting all the platform zeros in Europe](/projects/plat0), [speedrunning West Yorkshire National Rail stations](/projects/wymetro), and coding some random stuff. i also [rate hot chocolates](/projects/hot-choc). most things i do make it on to this website somewhere.
