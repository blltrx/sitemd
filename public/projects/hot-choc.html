<h1 class="title"><span class="hash">#</span>hot chocolate tierlist</h1>
<p>i've been ranking hot chocolate from various coffee shops for a little bit now, here are my reviews and current ranking. last updated 2025-03-01.</p>
<h2>Caff√® Nero</h2>
<p>hot chocolate classic: a bit bland and a bit sweet honestly fine. i've using this to be the reference point. (C)</p>
<p>luxury hot chocolate: richer, in some ill-defined way, better texture, different taste (better but not for me). (C)</p>
<h2>Spring Espresso (York)</h2>
<p>a perfect basic hot chocolate. very solid no flaws. (B)</p>
<h2>Stage (Leeds)</h2>
<p>hot chocolate: perfect texture, a bit melty, a bit too cocoa-y for me. (A-)</p>
<p>malted hot chocolate: perfect texture, a bit melty, a bit too cocoa-y for me, but now a bit malty yay! (A)</p>
<p>peppermint hot chocolate: surprisingly really good, i dont like anything remotely minty, but this is sutble and interesting. worst than usual because mint, but soo much better than expected. would happily drink a little bit because i find it interesting, but idk if i would want a whole cup. (B)</p>
<h2>Spoons</h2>
<p>watery, not very milky, awful texture, sweet, little cocoa /neg. (F+)</p>
<h2>C</h2>
<p>a friend of mine</p>
<p>hot chocolate (cadbury): not quite heavy enough, great taste. (A+)</p>
<p>hot chocolate (galaxy): not heavy enough, better, more chocolatly taste. what i remember costa tasting like before 2021. (S-)</p>
<h2>Costa</h2>
<p>hot chocolate: watery in taste and somewhat texture, sweet, little cocoa, much better than spoons tho. i swear it used to be soo much better. (C-) </p>
<p>winter black forest hot chocolate: the same as the normal hot chocolate, but with a berry syrup kinda thing. it's nicer, and sweeter in a fun way, but the sweetness is very discontinuous with the rest of the drink and feels like its just been added on top (because it has). (C)</p>
<h2>Cooplands</h2>
<p>watery in taste and somewhat texture, sweet, little cocoa, much better than spoons, worse than costa tho. (D) </p>
<h2>Winter Tent LUU '24</h2>
<p>salted caramel hot chocolate: watery in texture, but incredibly rich taste also alcahol yay! (A)</p>
<h2>GFAL</h2>
<p>watery in taste and texture. (D-)</p>
<h2>H</h2>
<p>a friend of mine.</p>
<p>good texture, weighy, but also not quite right (because non-dairy), sweet taste with some depth. (B+)</p>
<h2>Chocomel (microwaved milk)</h2>
<p>actually awful idk why but it tastes like alternative milk without any fun or goodness, unlike using actual alt. milks. disappointed because i love the milkshake. (F+)</p>
<h2>Mog's (Leeds)</h2>
<p>kind of watery compared to stage but otherwise good texture. sweet, chocolatey, and also something else that's good but idk what. (A-)</p>
<h2>Flamingos (Leeds)</h2>
<p>not nearly thick enough to compliment the chocolatey taste, but good taste. tastes properly like chocolate. demoted from b to b- on '25-03-01 (B-)</p>
<h2>200¬∞</h2>
<p>very similar to mogs, but substantially less flavourful, that being said much better texture and thats more important. (B+)</p>
<h2>Wapentake (Leeds) ('25-2)</h2>
<p>sweet, chocolatly, not thin, almost perfect. as with all hot chocolates could be thicker (A+)</p>
<h2>Kulture Coffee (Leeds) ('25-3)</h2>
<p>pretty plain and solid, in taste and texture (B+)</p>
