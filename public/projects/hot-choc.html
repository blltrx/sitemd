<h2 id="reviews">reviews</h2>
<h3 id="caffe-nero">Caff√® Nero</h3>
<p>hot chocolate classic: a bit bland and a bit sweet honestly fine. i've using this to be the reference point. (C)</p>
<p>luxury hot chocolate: richer, in some ill-defined way, better texture, different taste (better but not for me). (C)</p>
<p>white hot chocolate ('25-08): actually very nice, thicker licer texture, all over very good. (B+)</p>
<h3 id="spring-espresso-york">Spring Espresso (York)</h3>
<p>a perfect basic hot chocolate. very solid no flaws. (B)</p>
<h3 id="stage-leeds">Stage (Leeds)</h3>
<p>hot chocolate: perfect texture, a bit melty, a bit too cocoa-y for me. (A-)</p>
<p>malted hot chocolate: perfect texture, a bit melty, a bit too cocoa-y for me, but now a bit malty yay! (A)</p>
<p>peppermint hot chocolate: surprisingly really good, i dont like anything remotely minty, but this is sutble and interesting. worst than usual because mint, but soo much better than expected. would happily drink a little bit because i find it interesting, but idk if i would want a whole cup. (B)</p>
<p>oat milk hot chocolate ('25-03-05): i like the oat milk and the thickness/texture of the hot chocolate, but the taste of the stage hot chocolate (for me) is not complimented by the oat milk. the issue here is the specific combination tho, not the oat milk. (C+)</p>
<p>white hot chocolate ('25-08-20): ijgbsifehwobfno (S-)</p>
<h3 id="spoons">Spoons</h3>
<p>watery, not very milky, awful texture, sweet, little cocoa /neg. (F+)</p>
<h3 id="c">C</h3>
<p>a friend of mine</p>
<p>hot chocolate (cadbury): not quite heavy enough, great taste. (A+)</p>
<p>hot chocolate (galaxy): not heavy enough, better, more chocolatly taste. what i remember costa tasting like before 2021. (S-)</p>
<h3 id="costa">Costa</h3>
<p>hot chocolate: watery in taste and somewhat texture, sweet, little cocoa, much better than spoons tho. i swear it used to be soo much better. (C-) </p>
<p>winter black forest hot chocolate: the same as the normal hot chocolate, but with a berry syrup kinda thing. it's nicer, and sweeter in a fun way, but the sweetness is very discontinuous with the rest of the drink and feels like its just been added on top (because it has). (C)</p>
<h3 id="cooplands">Cooplands</h3>
<p>watery in taste and somewhat texture, sweet, little cocoa, much better than spoons, worse than costa tho. (D) </p>
<h3 id="winter-tent-luu-24">Winter Tent LUU '24</h3>
<p>salted caramel hot chocolate: watery in texture, but incredibly rich taste also alcahol yay! (A)</p>
<h3 id="gfal">GFAL</h3>
<p>watery in taste and texture. (D-)</p>
<h3 id="h">H</h3>
<p>a friend of mine.</p>
<p>good texture, weighy, but also not quite right (because non-dairy), sweet taste with some depth. (B+)</p>
<h3 id="chocomel-microwaved-milk">Chocomel (microwaved milk)</h3>
<p>actually awful idk why but it tastes like alternative milk without any fun or goodness, unlike using actual alt. milks. disappointed because i love the milkshake. (F+)</p>
<h3 id="mogs-leeds">Mog's (Leeds)</h3>
<p>kind of watery compared to stage but otherwise good texture. sweet, chocolatey, and also something else that's good but idk what. (A-)</p>
<h3 id="flamingos-leeds">Flamingos (Leeds)</h3>
<p>not nearly thick enough to compliment the chocolatey taste, but good taste. tastes properly like chocolate. demoted from b to b- on '25-03-01 (B-)</p>
<h3 id="200">200¬∞</h3>
<p>very similar to mogs, but substantially less flavourful, that being said much better texture and thats more important. demoted from B+ to B- on '25-03-05. (B-)</p>
<h3 id="canterbury-tails-canterbury">Canterbury Tails (Canterbury)</h3>
<p>fancy hot chocolate: unfortunately a bit bland and watery, idk if its non dairy but it tastes like it /pos but also tates creamy just without the texture to back it up. (C+)</p>
<h3 id="wapentake-leeds-25-2">Wapentake (Leeds) ('25-2)</h3>
<p>sweet, chocolatly, not thin, almost perfect. as with all hot chocolates could be thicker (A+)</p>
<h3 id="kulture-coffee-leeds-25-3">Kulture Coffee (Leeds) ('25-3)</h3>
<p>pretty plain and solid, in taste and texture (B+)</p>
<h3 id="92-25-3">92¬∞ ('25-3)</h3>
<p>almost the right texture, sweet enough, the right milkyness, but really disappointingly bland (C-) </p>
<h3 id="revive-food-mood-whitstable-25-4">Revive Food + Mood (Whitstable) ('25-4)</h3>
<p>brilliant hot chocolate poweder, but not made very well. texture definitely not thick enough and the drink was not strong enough. (B+)</p>
<h3 id="hot-numbers-cambridge-25-4">Hot Numbers (Cambridge) ('25-4)</h3>
<p>like stage, but even more to cocoa-y and bitter for me (B)</p>
<h3 id="kapow-25-6">Kapow ('25-6)</h3>
<p>Thorntons Arcade: very pretty, perfect texture, but way too bitter and cocoa-y, not to my taste. very milky however (yay).(C-)</p>
<p>The Calls: this one was very different, sweet, could be richer, and had a lovely thicker texture (S-)</p>
<h3 id="prufrock-coffee-25-09">Prufrock Coffee ('25-09)</h3>
<p>very bitter, fancy in a way i do not like, good texture however (D+)</p>
