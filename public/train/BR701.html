<h1 class="title"><span class="hash">#</span>i finally managed to ride a BR class 701</h1>
<p><img alt="BR class 701" src="/assets/train-701-1.webp" /></p>
<p>i've been trying to get on a BR class 701 for months now. every time i were i London i would be checking RealTimeTrains constantly to see if there was one operating at that time, but never managed to. until today! I was in London for a Los Campesinos! concert and decided to spend the day running up to the event with a day Travelcard. this time i didn't even check RTT i just happened to arrive in waterloo and it was there.</p>
<p><img alt="BR class 701 interior" src="/assets/train-701-2.webp" />
(i don't know why it's sideways, webp conversion things i guess i'll try fix it at some point no guarantees)</p>
<p>the interior is nice and spacious, with the feel of a TfL Overground BR Class 710 combined with a TL BR Class 700. It has nice information displays everywhere though i feel like they are very underutilised. the Elizabeth line makes excellent use of their displays with onwards connections and different stations, and many National Rail trains now show the next stations departure board on the display, as well as calling times of the coming stations. these trains do not implement this in a good way. often the features are missing, and with TfL connections, they seem to only be shown when the train is already pulling into the station. that being said they are generally pretty good, with that moden Aventra feel. a shame they've had so many problems coming into service, but i'm excited to see more of them.;w</p>
